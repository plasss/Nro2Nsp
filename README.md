This application will help you generate an NSP file for redirecting homebrew apps and rom forwarders for RetroArch

On the first run you will be prompted for your key file location and where you would like the NSP files to be saved. You can also change the settings for where files are located on your console.

This is just a simple UI for hacBrewPack, which has already been included inside the application.
